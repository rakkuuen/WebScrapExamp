# Web Scrape Demo

This is a web scrapping demo on some random sites I chose to get random data off of.

## Facebook

I will get a list of a persons friends and convert their details into a json file.
This will require the use to login through the terminal aswell.

## Smogon

I just want to get every pokemon name off of this site.
I will do that by typing each letter in the search bar and taking only the pokemon entries to get a full list.
For some reason the names of the pokemon are split into [first letter - rest of name] splits so thats something
to keep in mind when scrapping.
I also don't even need to do this in the seach bar because there is a page where all the pokemon just are but
like thats not the point... I am going to do it anyways just for fun.
Another thing to consider is that the page elements dont load if they are not on the page so I will need to scroll
as I am going through the pokemon untill there are no more pokemon elements.

# Future

These are just test to give myself tools in the future for scrapping so I might expand and add more scrape code
in order to explore more complex options and just improve my abilities.
